                  <section class="about-section">
                    <h3 class="about-title">Why build this website?</h3>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        During my studies in Digital Information for Organizations at the <a href="https://formations.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/bachelor-universitaire-de-technologie-BUT/but-information-numerique-dans-les-organisations-KQMDU7EY.html" class="school-link">University of Bordeaux</a>, 
                      I had the opportunity to develop this website as the first part of my Information Architecture 
                      course project, led by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Le_Deuff" class="teacher-link">olivier le Deuff</a>. The main objective was to apply what we learned 
                      about information hierarchy, design, and architecture by choosing one major figure in this field and creating a website about them and aesthetically inspired by their work.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-title">Why gamification?</h3>
                    <p class="about-text">
                      Among the different concepts introduced during the course, gamification immediately caught my 
                      attention. In my daily environment, I've noticed that people are often more excited to play a 
                      game than to complete last-minute necessary tasks. This is not simply "laziness": behavioral science 
                      shows that dopamine increases motivation, making activities feel easier and more engaging.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-text">
                        Gamification can be applied to almost every domain—education, business, the arts, humanities, 
                        and more. In this project, I chose to focus specifically on the <strong>8 core drives</strong> 
                        of <a href="https://www.yukaichou.com/" class="about-link">Yu-kai Chou</a> because his framework provides a comprehensive and scientifically-backed model for understanding human motivation and engagement.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-title">Why information architecture?</h3>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        Information architecture helps us shape how users navigate, understand, and interact with 
                        content. It transforms information into a coherent experience, ensuring clarity, usability, 
                        and meaningful engagement.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-title">How was this built?</h3>
                    <h4 class="about-subtitle">Content Research</h4>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        I first asked ChatGPT for an overview of major thinkers and influencers in this field. 
                        After choosing gamification, I continued my research using academic and online sources, 
                        which I list on the <a href="legal.html" class="legal-link">legal page</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="about-subtitle">Design</h4>
                    <p class="about-text">
                      The design was created in <a href="https://www.figma.com/" class="about-link">Figma</a>, with the illustrations produced in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" class="about-link">Adobe Illustrator</a> or mostly downloaded from free image banks like <a href="https://www.freepik.com/" class="about-link">Freepik</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
<p>
  I adapted several “fun-ctionalities” to express and integrate key principles from Yu-kai Chou’s gamification framework,
  including quizzes that invite visitors to assess their own knowledge, a highly reactive and image-rich clickable Octalysis octagon,
  engaging GIFs, and pixelated or hand-drawn typography inspired by video game aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
  I chose a minimal black-and-white interface inspired by presentation visuals encountered during the
  <a href="https://mica.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/events/cide-24-fabriques-de-donnees-dans-les-organisations/" class="cide-link">
    CIDE.24 – Fabriques de données dans les organisations
  </a>
  conference, particularly a presentation by Waldir Lisboa Rocha, whose visual research can be found on
  <a href="https://abrupt.cc/" class="abrupt-linl">abrupt.cc</a>.
  This visual approach can also be found in gaming interfaces such as <em>Gris</em> and other contemporary games.
  I do not believe that RGB color is necessary to create a compelling gaming experience.
</p>
<p>
  The structure of the design was carefully considered so that first-time visitors can easily access the information they need,
  while more curious users are naturally guided toward deeper content and additional resources.
  This balance between clarity and exploration reflects the core intention of the project:
  to create an accessible, meaningful, and engaging learning experience without overwhelming the user.

                    <h4 class="about-subtitle">Development</h4>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        The website was initially planned to be developed using WordPress and plugins, with custom frontend work in HTML, 
                        CSS, and JavaScript, and backend development in PHP and MySQL. In the end, i choose to use basic front end language (HTML, CSS and JS) 
                        to create this website as im looking to make something simple, accessible, light and easy to develop and create under short time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of choosing differents plugin on wordpress, i was able to integrate some functionality to my website using embed-ready 
                        hosted contact form with <a href="https://formspree.io/" class="about-link">Formspree</a> and <a href="https://qzzr.com/" class="about-link">Qzzr</a> for the quiz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The core code was written by me, with the help of
                    <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a>
                    to debug, refine, and improve code clarity.
                    The interactive Octalysis octagon and some content were also generated with AI,
                    ensuring fact-checked information and enabling a fast, efficient production process.

                    <h3 class="about-title">What is the objective of this website?</h3>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        The goal is to simplify and explain gamification principles while demonstrating how 
                        information architecture and design can create a clear, engaging learning experience.
                    </p>
